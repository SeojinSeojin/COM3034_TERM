## Korean Character Recognition using OpenCV

This project focuses on developing an AI model using OpenCV to restore damaged text on paper documents. By leveraging deep learning and computer vision, the aim was to extract characters from damaged paper and restore their meaning. The model's structure encompassed three main stages: reconstructing torn paper pieces into a single unit, character recognition (OCR), and inferring the lost sentence's meaning.

The model received images of **2,353** Korean complete characters, **40** consonants/vowels, **52** English upper/lowercase letters, and **10** digits.
